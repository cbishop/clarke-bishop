<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-strategic-cto-you-need-without-the-full-time-commitment">The Strategic CTO You Need <br>(Without the Full-Time Commitment)</h2>
<p>I help less technical CEOs and founders make sense of technology—especially when that technology is moving faster than their teams can adapt.</p>
<p>My background is unusual: I combine deep technical expertise (AWS certifications, production Gen AI deployments, enterprise data architecture) with business acumen (MBA, executive communication skills, numerous technical hires) and the rare ability to translate between both worlds.</p>
<p><strong>The result?</strong> Companies get strategic CTO-level guidance without the $300K+ salary and full-time commitment. You get me for 10-20 hours per week, focused entirely on moving your business forward.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="my-story-from-engineer-to-strategic-advisor" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="my-story-from-engineer-to-strategic-advisor">My Story: From Engineer to Strategic Advisor</h2>
<p>I’ve been in technology leadership roles since before “cloud” meant anything other than weather. But I’m not stuck in the past—I’m currently deploying some of the most cutting-edge AI systems available using AWS Bedrock, Agents, and production LLMs.</p>
<section id="how-i-got-here" class="level3 unlisted">
<h3 class="unlisted anchored" data-anchor-id="how-i-got-here">How I Got Here</h3>
<p>My journey started in electrical engineering, where I learned to think in systems and solve complex problems. I earned my Bachelor’s from Auburn, then a Master’s in Electrical Engineering from the University of Kentucky, diving deep into the technical foundations that still serve me today.</p>
<p>But I realized early that technology without business context is just interesting code. So I went back to school for an MBA in Finance from Georgia State University. That decision changed everything.</p>
<p><strong>Suddenly, I could speak two languages:</strong> the language of engineers and the language of executives. I could translate “we need to refactor our microservices architecture” into “this will reduce our infrastructure costs by 30% and let us ship features 2x faster.” That translation ability became my superpower.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-fractional-cto-model" class="level3 unlisted">
<h3 class="unlisted anchored" data-anchor-id="the-fractional-cto-model">The Fractional CTO Model</h3>
<p>For over 25 years, I’ve run my own technology consulting firm, Resultant Systems, serving companies from startups to Fortune 500 enterprises. I’ve worked across industries—FinTech, HealthTech, SaaS, manufacturing, payment processing, media, and more.</p>
<p>Along the way, I noticed a pattern: <strong>The companies that succeeded weren’t necessarily the ones with the most advanced technology. They were the ones that aligned their technology strategy to their business goals.</strong></p>
<p>That insight led me to formalize my fractional CTO practice. Rather than just delivering projects, I now partner with up to 3 companies at a time as their strategic technology advisor. I join leadership meetings, guide technical decisions, mentor teams, and ensure technology becomes a competitive advantage—not a cost center.</p>

<section id="pattern-recognition-across-industries" class="level3 unlisted">
<h3 class="unlisted anchored" data-anchor-id="pattern-recognition-across-industries">Pattern Recognition Across Industries</h3>
<p>I’ve worked with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Global payment processors</strong> handling enterprise-scale security and compliance</li>
<li><strong>SaaS platforms</strong> serving 500+ customers across 40 countries<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Financial services firms</strong> processing proprietary investment data</li>
<li><strong>Health tech startups</strong> navigating HIPAA and fragmented data ecosystems</li>
<li><strong>Manufacturing enterprises</strong> building analytics centers of excellence</li>
<li><strong>Media companies</strong> architecting streaming analytics pipelines</li>
</ul>
<p>This breadth gives me something most CTOs lack: <strong>I’ve seen this movie before.</strong> When you’re facing a technology decision, I can tell you what worked, what failed, and what expensive mistakes to avoid.</p>

<section id="current-cutting-edge-expertise" class="level3 unlisted">
<h3 class="unlisted anchored" data-anchor-id="current-cutting-edge-expertise">Current, Cutting-Edge Expertise</h3>
<p>While my experience is broad, my skills are current:</p>
<p><strong>Generative AI:</strong> I’m not just talking about Gen AI—I’m deploying production systems using AWS Bedrock, Anthropic’s Claude, Agents, and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation). I know the difference between impressive demos and systems that actually create business value.</p>
<p><strong>Data Strategy:</strong> Too many Gen AI initiatives fail because of data problems, not AI problems. I’ve architected data platforms using Snowflake, Databricks, AWS Glue, Spark, and modern data lake architectures. I know how to unlock trapped data and make it valuable.</p>
<p><strong>Cloud Architecture:</strong> I’m AWS certified (Solutions Architect, ML Specialty, Data Analytics Specialty) and have designed serverless, Kubernetes-based, and hybrid architectures that scale globally.</p>
<p><strong>MLOps &amp; Production Systems:</strong> I build frameworks that let teams deploy Gen AI to production in weeks, not months, with proper monitoring, evaluation, and iteration capabilities.</p>

<section id="executive-communication" class="level3 unlisted">
<h3 class="unlisted anchored" data-anchor-id="executive-communication">Executive Communication</h3>
<p>I’m a Pluralsight course author, teaching thousands of engineers about AWS data analytics and Python. If I can explain complex topics to engineers worldwide, I can certainly explain them to your board, investors, and leadership team.</p>
<p><strong>More importantly:</strong> I listen first. I invest time understanding your business model, competitive pressures, and strategic goals before recommending any technology. My job is to make technology serve your business—not the other way around.</p>

<section id="my-philosophy-focus-alignment-and-execution" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="my-philosophy-focus-alignment-and-execution">My Philosophy: Focus, Alignment, and Execution</h2>
<p>Most companies try to do everything at once. When you try to do everything, nothing happens.</p>
<p>My approach is simple:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Understand deeply</strong> - What are you actually trying to achieve? What are the business constraints? What does success look like?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Focus ruthlessly</strong> - What’s the one thing that, if we got it right, would move the needle most? Everything else is a distraction.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Build iteratively</strong> - Ship something that works, gather feedback, improve. Repeat. Perfect is the enemy of shipped.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop capabilities</strong> - Leave your team stronger than I found them. Build skills, improve communication, establish better processes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Measure outcomes</strong> - Track business metrics, not just technical metrics. Did we reduce costs? Accelerate time-to-market? Enable new revenue streams?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This philosophy has helped companies reduce onboarding time by 70%, accelerate Gen AI deployment 6x, and serve 500+ customers across 40 countries.</p>
<section id="what-i-dont-do" class="level3 unlisted">
<h3 class="unlisted anchored" data-anchor-id="what-i-dont-do">What I Don’t Do</h3>
<p>To be clear, I’m <strong>not</strong> looking to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be your full-time CTO (fractional only)</li>
<li>Manage large teams indefinitely (I build, mentor, then transition)</li>
<li>Work on projects without clear business outcomes</li>
<li>Take on more than 4 concurrent clients (I stay focused)</li>
</ul>

<section id="team-building-leadership" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="team-building-leadership">Team Building &amp; Leadership</h2>
<p>I’ve hired numerous technical professionals throughout my career and I’m experienced in the <strong>Topgrading methodology</strong> used by GE and leading private equity firms for executive-level recruitment.</p>
<p>But hiring is just the start. My real strength is <strong>developing high-performing technical teams</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>I adapt to each individual’s capabilities and career goals</li>
<li>I create clarity about priorities and strategic direction<br>
</li>
<li>I establish focus—doing fewer things better, not everything poorly</li>
<li>I build skills progressively through coaching and mentoring</li>
<li>I improve communication and alignment between technical and business teams</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Most team performance problems aren’t about capability—they’re about clarity, communication, and focus.</strong> I solve those problems.</p>

</section>
<section id="beyond-technology-teaching-and-thought-leadership" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="beyond-technology-teaching-and-thought-leadership">Beyond Technology: Teaching and Thought Leadership</h2>
<p>I believe in raising the entire industry, not just my clients. That’s why I:</p>
<p><strong>Teach Thousands:</strong> As a Pluralsight course author, I’ve created courses like “Analyzing Data on AWS” (part of the AWS Certified Data Analytics Specialty path) and “Exploring Web Scraping with Python.” These courses have taught thousands of engineers worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>Share Knowledge:</strong> I actively share insights about Gen AI implementation, data strategy, and fractional CTO best practices through LinkedIn articles and industry conversations.</p>
<p><strong>Mentor Engineers:</strong> In my client engagements, I code side-by-side with engineers, demonstrating techniques and building capabilities that outlast my engagement.</p>
<p>If you’re working with me, you’re not just getting strategic advice—you’re getting someone who invests in making your entire team better.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-makes-me-different-from-other-fractional-ctos">What Makes Me Different from <br>Other Fractional CTOs</h2>
<p><strong>Most fractional CTOs are either:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Too technical</strong> - They speak only in code and can’t communicate with executives</li>
<li><strong>Too strategic</strong> - They give advice but can’t roll up their sleeves and build</li>
<li><strong>Too narrow</strong> - They know one industry or one technology stack</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I’m different because:</strong></p>
<p>✓ <strong>I bridge both worlds</strong> - Deep technical expertise + executive communication + business acumen<br>
✓ <strong>I’m hands-on when needed</strong> - I can code side-by-side with your team or present to your board<br>
✓ <strong>I have broad pattern recognition</strong> - Multiple industries means I’ve seen more failure modes and success patterns<br>
✓ <strong>I’m current, not dated</strong> - Production Gen AI systems with AWS Bedrock, not “big data” from 2015<br>
✓ <strong>I focus on outcomes</strong> - Business metrics matter more than technical elegance</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-few-final-thoughts">A Few Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Technology changes rapidly. <strong>Strategic thinking doesn’t.</strong></p>
<p>The fundamentals of good architecture, clear communication, focused execution, and outcome-oriented development remain constant even as tools evolve. That’s what 25+ years of experience really means—not that I’ve used outdated tools, but that I’ve seen what works and what doesn’t across multiple technology cycles.</p>
<p>Right now, we’re in the middle of the Gen AI revolution. Most companies know they need to leverage it but don’t know how. <strong>That’s exactly where I can help.</strong></p>
<p>If you’re a CEO or founder who needs strategic technology leadership—someone who can both guide your team and explain complex topics to your board—let’s talk.</p>
<p>I might be exactly what your company needs.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Are you looking for full-time roles?</strong><br>
A: No.&nbsp;I’m exclusively doing fractional CTO work. It lets me work with multiple interesting companies and bring cross-company insights to each engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can you help us hire a full-time CTO?</strong><br>
A: Absolutely. I can help you define the role, recruit candidates (using Topgrading methodology), interview them, and even onboard them. Then I can transition out or stay on in a reduced advisory capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What if we just need help with one specific project?</strong><br>
A: I can do project-based work, but I’m most valuable as an ongoing strategic partner. Let’s discuss your needs and find the right structure.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Do you sign NDAs and work with confidential information?</strong><br>
A: Yes. All my client work is confidential. The outcomes I share publicly are anonymized and approved by clients.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What if we’re not sure we need a fractional CTO?</strong><br>
A: That’s what the strategy call is for. We’ll discuss your challenges and I’ll give you my honest assessment—even if that means recommending a different solution.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can you work on-site?</strong><br>
A: I’m based in Roswell, GA (Atlanta area) and primarily work remotely, but I’m available for periodic on-site strategic sessions, leadership meetings, or team workshops.</p>
