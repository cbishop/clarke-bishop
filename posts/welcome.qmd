## From Pilot to Production

Welcome to my blog. After 26 years building systems that scale, I'm sharing insights on turning AI experiments into production-ready solutions.

### What You'll Find Here

This blog focuses on practical, actionable guidance for:

- **AI Implementation**: Moving from proof-of-concept to production
- **Technical Leadership**: Building and scaling engineering teams
- **System Architecture**: Designing systems that handle real-world load
- **ROI Measurement**: Demonstrating value from technical initiatives

### The Challenge

Too many organizations get stuck in the "pilot phase" with AI. They have interesting demos but can't get to production. The gap isn't technology—it's execution.

### My Approach

I help bridge that gap with:

1. Specific, actionable guidance (not buzzwords)
2. Focus on measurable outcomes
3. Practical implementation strategies
4. Real-world experience from 26+ years

```python
# Example: Simple AI validation pattern
def validate_ai_output(result, threshold=0.85):
    """Ensure AI outputs meet quality standards before production use."""
    if result.confidence < threshold:
        return fallback_to_human_review(result)
    return result
```

Stay tuned for detailed posts on AI implementation, technical leadership, and building systems that scale.
